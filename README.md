## Installation
This project was completed from scratch. I referenced course material from the University of Minnesota's Coding bootcamp to assist me as well as online resources to create my skeleton. Once that is completed, it is just trouble shooting from there (mainly using nodemon).

## Usage
This application creates a very simple logo design for the user based off of their answers to the app prompts.
